# Strategic Thinking - Capstone CA2

# World Development Indicator Dataset - Predicting Conditions for GDP per Capita in Sub-Saharan Africa 

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to use data analysis methods to obtain
a deeper understanding of the major factors that influence economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study 
will do this by using three machine learning methods -

 - Artificial Neural Networks
 - Random Forest 
 - Support Vector Machines

 By fine tuning the models for these approaches we hope to gain insights applicable to our chosen domain.
